## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Modern CSS Features:
  - clamp() for fluid typography
  - CSS Grid areas
  - text-wrap: pretty
  - Custom properties for design tokens

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in several areas:

1.Advanced CSS Grid Layout:

```css
main {
  @media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
    grid-template-areas:
      "create social social time"
      "create manage maintain time"
      "write manage maintain time"
      "write growth followers followers";
  }
}
```

2.Fluid Typography using clamp():

```css
--fs-2xl: clamp(2.3328rem, 2.0827rem + 1.2504vw, 3.0518rem);
```

Responsive Design with Custom Properties:

```css
:root {
  --space-m: clamp(1.6875rem, 1.6223rem + 0.3261vw, 1.875rem);
}
```

const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Areas I plan to focus on in future projects:

- Implementing more advanced animations and transitions
- Enhancing accessibility features
- Exploring CSS Container Queries
- Adding more interactive elements
- Optimizing performance further
